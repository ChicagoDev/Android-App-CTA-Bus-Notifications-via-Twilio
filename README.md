### Android CTA Bus Tracker ~ A 48-hour case study in UX and Android development

#### Why?

At CTA stops, when checking wait times, the user must repeatedly type the CTA's short code while sending a text message. Or they must navigate through their long list of text-message threads to locate their previous texts to the CTA. This is repetitive and unnecessary. 

This app provides an improvement in user-experience because it reduces [cognitive load](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/minimize-cognitive-load/) within users. Features which reduce cognitive load are:

* Offloading tasks, like storing the CTA's short code (41411), which enables an SMS to be sent in the background. 
* A numeric keypad replaces the QWERTY keyboard, which speeds the ability for a user to hone and tap. 


##### Demo

##### Old way: 
This is an example video of how you would interact with the CTA's track by text feature without this Android app:
